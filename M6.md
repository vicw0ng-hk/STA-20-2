# Problem Solving Session 3 - Arrays & Strings

Hong Kong - 23 Mar 2021

## Problem 1 - Linear Search (Variant)
(**Programming Problem 1** on pages *8-10* from *Guidance Notes 6.1* and sample code from pages 4-7)
```cpp
// linear search of key value in array[]
// return the index of first occurrence of key in array[]
// return -1 if key is not found in array[]
int linearSearch(const int array[], int sizeOfArray, int key) {
  for (int j = 0; j < sizeOfArray; ++j)
    if (array[j] == key) // if found,
      return j;          // return location of key
  return -1;             // key not found
}

int main() {
  const int arraySize = 10;  // size of array
  int a[arraySize];        // declare array a
  int searchKey;             // value to locate in array a

  // fill in some data to array
  for (int i = 0; i < arraySize; ++i)
    a[i] = 2 * i;

  cout << "Enter an integer to search: ";
  cin >> searchKey; 

  // try to locate searchKey in a
  int element = linearSearch(a, arraySize, searchKey);

  // display search results
  if (element != -1)
    cout << "Value found in element " << element << endl;
  else
    cout << "Value not found" << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

- The function `linearSearch()` returns only the first occurrence of the search item.
- What if we need the locations of ALL occurrences of the search item?
- How to make changes to `linearSearch()` so that we can make use of it to look for all occurrences of an item?
- What does `linearSearch()` return?
- How about if we start searching from the returned position of a previous call of `linearSearch()`?
- Function prototype for new `linearSearch()`:
```cpp
// linear search of key value in array[]
// starting search from startPos
// return the index of first occurrence of key in array[]
// return -1 if key is not found in array[]
int linearSearch(const int array[], int sizeOfArray, int key, int startPos);
```
- The `main()` function also needs some modification, so that `linearSearch()` will be called repeatedly until no more search item can be found.

## Problem 2

### Part(a)
- Write a C program which reads a character from user input and determine whether the character is a digit or an alphabet. (Refer to `charfunc.c` on *p.9* of *Guidance Notes 6.4*). Use the `isdigit()`, `isalph()`, functions from `ctype.h`.
- Change your program to accomplish the same task without using any character functions from `ctype.h`.

### Part(b)
- Write a C program which reads a string from user input and determine its length. Use the `strlen()` function from `string.h`. Assume that the maximum length of the input string is `99`.
- Change your program to accomplish the same task without using any string functions from `string.h`.
