## Problem Solving Session 4 - Structs & Recursion

Hong Kong - 30 Mar 2021

## Problem 1 - Structs
(**Programming Problem 1** on page *21* from *Guidance Notes 7.2* and sample code from pages *19-20*)
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

// 2D point
struct Point {
    double x;
    double y;
};

// distance between two points p and q
double point_distance(Point p, Point q) {
    double dx = p.x - q.x;
    double dy = p.y - q.y;
    return sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
}

// get a point from user input
Point input_point() {
    double x, y;
    cin >> x >> y;
    Point p = {x, y};
    return p;
}

// swap two points p and q
void swap(Point &p, Point &q) {
    Point temp = p;
    p = q;
    q = temp;
}

int main() {
    cout << "Input 1st point (x,y): ";
    Point a = input_point();

    cout << "Input 2nd point (x,y): ";
    Point b = input_point();

    cout << "Distance between point: " << point_distance(a, b) << endl;

    swap(a, b);
    cout << "1st point: " << a.x << ' ' << a.y << endl;
    cout << "2nd point: " << b.x << ' ' << b.y << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

- Add a function named `midpoint()` in `spoint.cpp`, which returns the mid-point of two 2D points.
```cpp
// mid-point of two points p and q
Point midpoint(Point p, Point q);
```
- Add a function named `shrink_line()` in `spoint.cpp`, which shrinks a line defined by two endpoints as follows:
```cpp
// shrink a line with endpoints p and q
void shrink_line(Point &p, Point &q);
```

### Notes on sample code
#### [struct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struct_(C_programming_language))
A [composite data type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_data_type). Notice the [difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_classes#Differences_between_a_structure_and_a_class_in_C++) to a C++ class. 

#### pass by value, pass by reference & pass by pointer
Discussed in [Problem Solving Session 2](M5.md). 

`double point_distance(Point p, Point q)` uses pass-by-value and `void swap(Point &p, Point &q)` uses pass-by-reference. We can change them both to pass-by-pointer:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

// 2D point
struct Point {
    double x;
    double y;
};

// distance between two points p and q
double point_distance(Point *p, Point *q) {
    double dx = p->x - q->x; // -> (*p).x
    double dy = p->y - q->y;
    return sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
}

// get a point from user input
Point input_point() {
    double x, y;
    cin >> x >> y;
    Point p = {x, y};
    return p;
}

// swap two points p and q
void swap(Point *p, Point *q) {
    Point temp = *p;
    *p = *q;
    *q = temp;
}

int main() {
    cout << "Input 1st point (x,y): ";
    Point a = input_point();

    cout << "Input 2nd point (x,y): ";
    Point b = input_point();

    cout << "Distance between point: " << point_distance(&a, &b) << endl;

    swap(&a, &b);
    cout << "1st point: " << a.x << ' ' << a.y << endl;
    cout << "2nd point: " << b.x << ' ' << b.y << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### revisiting `swap()`
Discussed in [Problem Solving Session 2](M5.md#swap).

Can we use (`+` & `-`) or (`*` & `/`) on `Point`? No directly but still doable! 

The compiler doesn't know what you mean by `+` in `Point c = a + b` because the compiler doesn't know what you mean by `+` on a composite data type. You could use [operator overloading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_overloading) to define it for the compiler. Or, just use it on its members if at all possible:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

// 2D point
struct Point {
    double x;
    double y;
};

// distance between two points p and q
double point_distance(Point p, Point q) {
    double dx = p.x - q.x;
    double dy = p.y - q.y;
    return sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
}

// get a point from user input
Point input_point() {
    double x, y;
    cin >> x >> y;
    Point p = {x, y};
    return p;
}

// swap two points p and q
void swap(Point &p, Point &q) {
    p.x += q.x;
    q.x = p.x - q.x;
    p.x -= q.x;

    p.y += q.y;
    q.y = p.y - q.y;
    p.y -= q.y;
}

int main() {
    cout << "Input 1st point (x,y): ";
    Point a = input_point();

    cout << "Input 2nd point (x,y): ";
    Point b = input_point();

    cout << "Distance between point: " << point_distance(a, b) << endl;

    swap(a, b);
    cout << "1st point: " << a.x << ' ' << a.y << endl;
    cout << "2nd point: " << b.x << ' ' << b.y << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Solution

In a [Cartesian coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system), consider vectors *OP* and *OQ*, it becomes a [convex combination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_combination) problem. 

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

// 2D point
struct Point {
    double x;
    double y;
};

// distance between two points p and q
double point_distance(Point p, Point q) {
    double dx = p.x - q.x;
    double dy = p.y - q.y;
    return sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
}

// get a point from user input
Point input_point() {
    double x, y;
    cin >> x >> y;
    Point p = {x, y};
    return p;
}

// swap two points p and q
void swap(Point &p, Point &q) {
    Point temp = p;
    p = q;
    q = temp;
}

// return mid-point of two points p and q
Point midpoint(Point p, Point q) {
    Point r = {(p.x + q.x)/2.0, (p.y + q.y)/2.0};
    return r;
}

// shrink a line with endpoints p and q
// the input points p and q will be changed
void shrink_line(Point &p, Point &q) {
  Point p1 = {0.75*p.x+0.25*q.x, 0.75*p.y+0.25*q.y};
  Point q1 = {0.25*p.x+0.75*q.x, 0.25*p.y+0.75*q.y};

  p = p1;
  q = q1;
}

int main() {
    cout << "Input 1st point (x,y): ";
    Point a = input_point();

    cout << "Input 2nd point (x,y): ";
    Point b = input_point();

    cout << "Distance between point: " << point_distance(a, b) << endl;

    swap(a, b);
    cout << "1st point: " << a.x << ' ' << a.y << endl;
    cout << "2nd point: " << b.x << ' ' << b.y << endl;

    // add function calls to test new functions
    cout << endl;
    Point m = midpoint(a, b);
    cout << "mid-point: " << m.x << ' ' << m.y << endl;

    shrink_line(a, b);
    cout << "after shrink: " << endl;
    cout << "1st point: " << a.x << ' ' << a.y << endl;
    cout << "2nd point: " << b.x << ' ' << b.y << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Problem 2 - Recursion
Write a recursive function to sort an array of integers into ascending order using the following idea: 

Place the smallest element in the ﬁrst position, then sort the rest of the array by a recursive call. This is a recursive version of the selection sort algorithm we discussed in Module 6.1. (Question taken from the reference book: *Problem Solving with C++*)

The following slide reviews what how selection sort works:
