## Problem Solving Session 5 - Pointers & Dynamic Arrays

Hong Kong - 13 Apr 2021

## Problem 1 - Pointers

What is the output produced by the following code?

```cpp
int *p1, *p2; 
p1 = new int; 
p2 = new int; 
*p1 = 10; 
*p2 = 20; 
cout << *p1 << " " << *p2 << endl; 
p1 = p2; 
cout << *p1 << " " << *p2 << endl; 
*p1 = 30; 
cout << *p1 << " " << *p2 << endl;
```

How would the output change if you were to replace
```cpp
*p1 = 30; 
```
with the following?
```cpp
*p2 = 30;
```

## Problem 2 - Dynamic Arrays

Write a program that asks the user to input an integer `n`. Create a dynamic array that can store `n` doubles and make a loop that allows the user to enter a double into each array entry. Loop through the array, calculate the average, and output it. Delete the memory allocated to your dynamic array before exiting.
