## Problem Solving Session 5 - Pointers & Dynamic Arrays

Hong Kong - 13 Apr 2021

## Problem 1 - Pointers

What is the output produced by the following code?

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int *p1, *p2; 
  p1 = new int; 
  p2 = new int; 
  *p1 = 10; 
  *p2 = 20; 
  cout << *p1 << " " << *p2 << endl; 
  p1 = p2; 
  cout << *p1 << " " << *p2 << endl; 
  // *p1 = 30; 
  *p2 = 30;
  cout << *p1 << " " << *p2 << endl;
}
```

How would the output change if you were to replace
```cpp
*p1 = 30; 
```
with the following?
```cpp
*p2 = 30;
```

### Notes

I believe I have gone ahead of schedule and talked about the topics involved here in previous sessions already. This problem should not be difficult.

To understand
```cpp
int *p1, *p2; 
```
```cpp
*p1 = 10; 
*p2 = 20; 
```
and
```cpp
*p1 = 30; 
```
refer to [Session 2](M5.md) on the use of `&` and `*` in declarations and elsewhere, or [read more](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/cpp/cp4_PointerReference.html).

What is a [pointer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming)) anyway? An object that stores an address. So you can understand what happened at
```cpp
p1 = p2; 
```

So the answer to the problem is
```
10 20
20 20
30 30
```

#### Go Crazy

But we should not be satified with just answering the question correctly. We can ask ourselved crazy questions like "can we have a pointer pointing to a pointer?", which can help us understand the concepts of pointer even better. 

So can we?

Totally!

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main () {
  int  var = 30;
  int  *ptr;
  int  **pptr;

  /* take the address of var */
  ptr = &var;

  /* take the address of ptr using address of operator & */
  pptr = &ptr;

  /* take the value using pptr */
  cout << "Value of var = " << var << endl;
  cout << "Value available at *ptr = " << *ptr << endl;
  cout << "Value available at **pptr = " << **pptr << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

Just use two `*`'s and you have a pointer pointing to a pointer pointing to a pointer.

Can we go even crazier?

Can a pointer point to itself?

Yes and no. 

In a "normal" declaration, we can totally do `int *p = &p;`. But what purpose does that serve? Remember in C/C++ pointers have types. `p` here is a pointer to an integer, but also a pointer to a pointer to an integer? That can't be right! So in normal sense, `p` is not pointing to itself and you can't dereference it, because `p` is supposed to point to an `int` but is now pointing to an pointer pointing to an `int`. Ahhhhhh!!!

![crazy](src/crazy.gif)

We can use a `void *` pointer, a pointer stripped of any type.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
  // https://cplusplus.com/forum/beginner/81388/#msg437256
  void * p = &p;
  cout << p << endl;
  cout << &p << endl;
  // Since p doesn't have a type, dereferencing is more difficult
  cout << *static_cast<void**>(p) << endl; 
  return 0;
}
```

This has little practical meaning but a good exercise for you to understand pointer. 

Can we have two pointers pointing to each other?

Very similarly, we still have problems with types, so we could only use `void *` type.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
  void *p1, *p2;
  p1 = &p2;
  p2 = &p1;
  cout << &p1 << endl; // address of p1
  cout << p1 << endl; // address p1 is pointing to, which is address of p2
  cout << *static_cast<void**>(p1) << endl; // address p2 is pointing to, which is address of p1
  return 0;
}
```

#### Advanced topic from last session
<blockquote>
Do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_swap_algorithm">XOR Swap</a> on the struct's pointers. Notice in <code>void swap(Point *&p, Point *&q)</code>, the pointers are passed by reference. The example also demonstrated, in <code>main()</code>, <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/new-vs-malloc-and-free-vs-delete-in-c/">dynamic memory management</a> in both C and C++. Also notice the complex <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_conversion">type conversion</a> involved in <code>swap()</code> and <code>main()</code>. <br>

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdlib>
using namespace std;

// 2D point
struct Point {
    double x;
    double y;
};

// swap two points p and q
void swap(Point *&p, Point *&q) {
    p = (Point *)(((uintptr_t)p) ^ ((uintptr_t)q));
    q = (Point *)(((uintptr_t)q) ^ ((uintptr_t)p));
    p = (Point *)(((uintptr_t)p) ^ ((uintptr_t)q));
}

// get a point from user input
Point input_point() {
    double x, y;
    cin >> x >> y;
    Point p = {x, y};
    return p;
}

int main() {
    cout << "Input 1st point (x,y): ";
    Point *a = new Point;
    *a = input_point();

    cout << "Input 2nd point (x,y): ";
    Point *b = (Point *)malloc(sizeof(Point));
    *b = input_point();

    swap(a, b);
    cout << "1st point: " << a->x << ' ' << a->y << endl;
    cout << "2nd point: " << b->x << ' ' << b->y << endl;

    delete a;
    free(b);

    return 0;
}
```

Frequent and/or complicated date type conversion is irregular and could be dangerous, but if you know what you are doing, you could create truly smart algorithms, such as [fast inverse square root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root).

## Problem 2 - Dynamic Arrays

Write a program that asks the user to input an integer `n`. Create a dynamic array that can store `n` doubles and make a loop that allows the user to enter a double into each array entry. Loop through the array, calculate the average, and output it. Delete the memory allocated to your dynamic array before exiting.
