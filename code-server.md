# [code-server](https://github.com/cdr/code-server)

Run [VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) on the [CS department](https://www.cs.hku.hk/)'s [`academy`](https://intranet.cs.hku.hk/csintranet/contents/technical/howto/account.jsp#login) server and open it in your local device's browser. 

### Current method of coding on `academy` server

- Text editors such as [VIM](https://github.com/vim/vim), [GNU nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/) in terminal after [`SSH`](https://intranet.cs.hku.hk/csintranet/contents/technical/howto/ssh.jsp#connectcs)
- Text editors such as [Gedit](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gedit) after connecting via [X2Go](https://intranet.cs.hku.hk/csintranet/contents/technical/howto/x2go/index.jsp)
- Using local text editors to open files during SFTP connection.

### Why code-server?

It resembles the [CS50 IDE](https://ide.cs50.io/) used by [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/)'s [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/) and is even more powerful. It provides access to file manager, terminal emulator, text editor, a huge selection of extensions and so much more, in a browser. 

It is easier to get used to than Vim and nano. 

It requires less bandwidth than X2Go and hence is a lot smoother. 

It provides an integratd coding environment so you don't have to switch apps between writing and compiling.
