## Problem Solving Session 2 - Functions and Array Basics

Hong Kong - 02 Mar 2021

## Problem 1

Write a `void` function `OrderThreeIntegers()` that takes three `int` arguments by reference. The function should determine the order of the values, and upon return of the function, it should modify the values in the arguments so that the first argument contains the largest value, the second the second-largest, and the third the smallest value.

- You may need another function to swap the values of two `int` arguments
- Write a simple driver program (i.e., `main()`) to test your functions. You should print out the values before and after calling `OrderThreeIntegers()` to show it works correctly.

We can divide the problem into three sub-tasks: [Swap](#swap), [Sort](#sort) and [Test](#test). 

### Swap

The traditional swap algorithm using a temporary variable:
```cpp
void Swap(int &p, int &q) {
  int tmp = p;
  p = q;
  q = tmp;
}
```

Without temporary variable, you could also try using addition and subtraction:
```cpp
void Swap(int &p, int &q) {
  p += q;
  q = p - q;
  p -= q;
}
```

Or multiplication and division:
```cpp
void Swap(int &p, int &q) {
  p *= q;
  q = p / q;
  p /= q;
}
```

However, these two methods are slow and risk overflow in C++. Division also fails with 0. 

There is also [XOR swap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_swap_algorithm):
```cpp
void Swap(int &p, int &q) {
  p ^= q;
  q ^= p;
  p ^= q;
}
```

While an improvement on the previous two methods, it has [its own peoblems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_swap_algorithm#Reasons_for_avoidance_in_practice). It's a good idea just to stick to the temporary variable method. 

Call the 4 functions above: `Swap(x, y);`

The Lecture introduced pass by reference but did not mention pass by pointer ([comparison](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/passing-by-pointer-vs-passing-by-reference-in-c/)). If you write as pass by pointer:
```cpp
void Swap(int *p, int *q) {
  int tmp = *p;
  *p = *q;
  *q = tmp;
}
```

XOR swap with pass by pointer:
```cpp
void Swap(int *p, int *q) {
  *p ^= *q;
  *q ^= *p;
  *p ^= *q;
}
```

Call the 2 functions above: `Swap(&x, &y);`

Note the difference of the meanings of `&` and `*` when they appear in a function or variable declaration and as an operator. 

| Example   | Meaning                             |
| :-------- | :---------------------------------- |
| `int &a;` | declare a reference `a`             |
| `&b`      | the address of `b`                  |
| `int *c;` | declare a pointer `c` of type `int` |
| `*d`      | dereference `d`                     |

### Sort

We only have 3 integers here. It doesn't matter what algorithm we choose. 

Bubble sort:
```cpp
void OrderThreeIntegers(int &x, int &y, int &z) {
  if (x < y)
    Swap(x, y);
  if (y < z)
    Swap(y, z);
  if (x < y)
    Swap(x, y);
}
```

If we have large number of elements to sort, we'll need to use a better [sorting algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm). For example, [counting sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_sort) is appropriate for [Problem 2](#problem-2).

### Test

How many test cases do we need? 

Is it 6? 

Yes, but why?

Not simply because we have three integers and 3! = 6. We need to look at this in the perspective of [code coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage). 

There are 3 if-statements in [Sort](#sort). For [branch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-to-decision_path) coverage, do we need to test 2<sup>2</sup> = 8 cases? 

Ordered by appearance in code, the cases where boolean expressions being `False-False-True` and `True-False-True` does not exist. Can you work out the logic behind this?

Hence the number of test cases is 2<sup>3</sup> - 2 = 6.

```cpp
int main() {
  int testCases[6][3] = {{0, 1, 2}, {0, 2, 1}, {1, 0, 2}, {1, 2, 0}, {2, 0, 1}, {2, 1, 0}};

  for (int i = 0; i < 6; ++i) {
    int a = testCases[i][0], b = testCases[i][1], c = testCases[i][2];
    // before ordering
    cout << "before ordering: " << a << " " << b << " " << c << endl;

    OrderThreeIntegers(a, b, c);

    // after ordering
    cout << "before ordering: " << a << " " << b << " " << c << endl;

    if (a == 2 && b == 1 && c == 0)
      cout << "Correct!" << endl;
    else
      cout << "Fail!" << endl;
    if (i != 5)
      cout << "=======================" << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

## Problem 2

Write a program to read in a sequence of integers in the range from `0` to `10`, and to find the mode of the input numbers (i.e., the number which occurs most frequently).

- Write a function `int FindMax(int a[], int aSize)` which returns the index of the largest element in the array `a[]`. The size of `a[]` is given by `aSize`:
  - If multiple elements have the same largest value, return the largest index of these elements;
- Write the `main()` function of the program:
  - Define an array `freq[]` of 11 integers; each element will store the frequency of occurrences of an integer. For example, `freq[i]` stores the frequency of the number i in the input sequence;
  - Read a sequence of integers from user input which is terminated by a sentinel value `-1`. For each input integer, increment the corresponding frequency counter in the array `freq[]`;
  - Outputs the frequencies of all numbers from `0` to `10`, and output the mode of the input numbers.
