## Problem Solving Session 2 - Functions and Array Basics

Hong Kong - 02 Mar 2021

## Problem 1

Write a `void` function `OrderThreeIntegers()` that takes three `int` arguments by reference. The function should determine the order of the values, and upon return of the function, it should modify the values in the arguments so that the first argument contains the largest value, the second the second-largest, and the third the smallest value.

- You may need another function to swap the values of two `int` arguments
- Write a simple driver program (i.e., `main()`) to test your functions. You should print out the values before and after calling `OrderThreeIntegers()` to show it works correctly.

## Problem 2

Write a program to read in a sequence of integers in the range from `0` to `10`, and to find the mode of the input numbers (i.e., the number which occurs most frequently).

- Write a function `int FindMax(int a[], int aSize)` which returns the index of the largest element in the array `a[]`. The size of `a[]` is given by `aSize`:
  - If multiple elements have the same largest value, return the largest index of these elements;
- Write the `main()` function of the program:
  - Define an array `freq[]` of 11 integers; each element will store the frequency of occurrences of an integer. For example, `freq[i]` stores the frequency of the number i in the input sequence;
  - Read a sequence of integers from user input which is terminated by a sentinel value `-1`. For each input integer, increment the corresponding frequency counter in the array `freq[]`;
  - Outputs the frequencies of all numbers from `0` to `10`, and output the mode of the input numbers.
